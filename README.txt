These are some of the projects I did.

The ants folder contains the code (in Python) and images for the game "Ants vs Some Bees" which is a watered-down UCB vs Stanford version of "Plants vs. Zombies"

The project 1 folder has code and images for image-processing software which utilizes the Sobel edge-detection algorithm and blurring algorithms.
